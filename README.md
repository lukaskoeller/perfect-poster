# 👩‍🎨 perfect-poster

## How it works
Perfect poster is a fun game to play together in a group, remotely or face-to-face. It works by each player creating a painting within 120 seconds.
What each players is painting is completely up to their creativity. After that, roles are changing and every player gets a painting of another player.
This time, the player needs to find a fitting title to the painting, making it a unique and funny poster. After that round, the final results can be
viewed and liked. The poster with the most likes wins.
